Description: The Scanning Probabilistic QTL Validator package allows for the easy assessment of any QTL mapping experiment. The package is designed to assess the number of previously identified genes for a trait of interest that are present within the confidence intervals of the QTL. This number is compared to the expected number of identified genes, as calculated over a large number of simulations.
